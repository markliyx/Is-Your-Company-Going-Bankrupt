# Is-Your-Company-Going-Bankrupt
In this project, I explore and examine a dataset about bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies. First found on Kaggle, this dataset is directly from the Machine Learning Repository of University of California, Irvine. The link to the dataset is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data#.

The data was originally collected from Emerging Markets Information Service (https://www.emis.com/), which is a database containing information on emerging markets around the world. The bankrupt companies were analyzed in the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evaluated from 2007 to 2013.

My objective is to provide insight to finding important factors that can help predict company bankruptcies more accurately through our exploration and analysis of this particular dataset.
